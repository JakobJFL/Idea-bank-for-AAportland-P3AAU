# Idea-bank-for-AAportland-P3AAU
This repository is a webserver developed as a P3 project at Aalborg University. This system is made for Aalborg Portland, which is a factory producing cement in Denmark. They needed an ideabank where employees can submit ideas for projects, like improving the production. Project leaders will act as administrators in the system and can review these ideas.
